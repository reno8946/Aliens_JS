## Overview of UFOs Analysis
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

- The data table displays on the webpage successfully as displayed in the image below with 5 filter boxes shown on the left hand side, including date, city, state, country, and shape

- You can then filter by one specific category, such as date by typing in the desired date in the datetime format indicated in the text box and press enter and the filter will be executed (see image below)

- Alternatively, you can narrow your filter search even more by typing in values for all 5 filter box items or as many as you need and then press enter and the filter will be executed to display only the row(s) that you need (see image below)

## UFOs Analysis Summary

One drawback of the current setup for the webpage is that you have to keep refeshing the page after performing a specific filter and executing it. One major thing I would change to make things more efficient for the user would be to add a drop down box list of each item within each collumn rather than the user having to type it into the text box. Two additions to the webpage data table could be to add a column for images that people who have them can post of the "UFO" they witnessed as well as a column of how many others were with them at the time they witnessed the object to back their claim and provide another line of evidence.
